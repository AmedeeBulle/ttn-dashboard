# Introduction
_TTN Dashboard_ provides an easy to setup environment for displaying [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) application data on a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard.

This setup is based on Containers orchestrated by [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).\
It does not require a lot of resources and can run on a small Linux cloud instance or an ARM based device like a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

The project uses the following container images:  
- An [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) reverse proxy, composed of the following images:
  - [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx): the NGINX reverse proxy itself
  - [docker-gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen): a configuration generator for NGINX
  - [letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion): manages [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates (optional)
- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/): user friendly interface to collect data from [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), process it and store it into a database
- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/): Time series database to store the data
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/): provides web-based dashboards from the stored data
- [httpd](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd): transient container providing the `htpasswd` utility to encrypt and store password for the web services

# Requirements
## Linux host
You will need a Linux host with `docker`, `docker-compose` and `git` installed.  
Minimum required versions are:
- `docker`: 17.06.0 or above
- `docker-compose`: 1.18.0 or above

However, for security reason, latest versions are strongly recommended.

## Domain names
If you want to expose your dashboard to the Internet, you will need domain names.\
The NGINX reverse proxy uses the domain name to route the requests to either Grafana or Node-RED; you will needs two domain names pointing to your server -- e.g.: `ttn-grafana.example.com` and `ttn-node.example.com`.\
If you don't have your own domain you can use a free service like [Duck DNS](https://www.duckdns.org).

For local/home usage (intranet) you can use a local DNS server or even the _hosts_ file of your workstation.

# Installation
## Initial setup
1. Clone this repository and enter its directory:  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/oracle/AmedeeBulle/ttn-dashboard.git
  cd ttn-dashboard
  ```
1. Copy the `.env.distr` file to `.env`  
  ```
  cp .env.distr .env
  ```
1. Customize the `.env` file to your needs, the following parameters are mandatory:  
  - Host names
    - `TTN_GRAFANA_HOST`: the hostname to access the Grafana dashboard -- e.g.: `ttn-grafana.example.com`
    - `TTN_NODE_RED_HOST`: the hostname to access the Node-RED interface -- e.g.: `ttn-node.example.com`
  - InfluxDB
    - `TTN_INFLUX_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: administration password
    - `TTN_INFLUX_PASSWORD`: password for the user with read/write access (used in Node-RED to insert data)
    - `TTN_INFLUX_READ_PASSWORD`: password for the user with read-only access (used in Grafana to query the database)
  - Grafana
    - `TTN_GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: password for the admin user (additional users are defined in Grafana itself)
1. Building container images.  
  The proxy helper images are only available for the `x86-64` architecture; if you run this setup on a different architecture, you will need to build these images as well.
    - `x86-64` architecture: this is the common case, only the `Node-RED` container image needs to be built:
    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```
    - Non `x86-64` architecture (Raspberry Pi, ...):
    ```
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-build.yml build
    ```
1. Set a username/password to access the Node-RED instance.  
  This is important as there is no user management in Node-RED!
  ```
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-htpasswd.yml \
    run --rm htpasswd \
    ./bin/htpasswd -bc /htpasswd/<NODE_FQDN> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>
  ```
  with
    - `<NODE_FQDN>`: the Node-RED domain name (same as `TTN_NODE_RED_HOST`)
    - `<USERNAME>`/`<PASSWORD>`: the username/password you want to use to authenticate to Node-RED
1. Start the containers (use _Control-C_ to stop):
  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```

The InfluxDB database will be created and initialised the first time the container runs.

You should be able to browse to your new Node-RED/Grafana setup using the specified domain names.

## Managing Containers
Basic `docker-compose` commands.

Start the containers (in _detached_ mode):
```
docker-compose up -d
```

View the log (use `-f` to follow log output):
```
docker-compose logs [-f]
```

Stop (kill) the containers:
```
docker-compose kill
```

Stop and destroy the containers:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Adding Secure HTTP (HTTPS)
If you expose your setup to the Internet you should enable `HTTPS` to encrypt the traffic.

This will happen automatically once you enable the `letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion` container:

1. Set the `PROXY_EMAIL` variable in the `.env` configuration file.  
  Provide a valid email address so that Let's Encrypt can warn you about expiring certificates and allow you to recover your account
1. Stop the containers (if they already run)
  ```
  docker-compose down
  ```
1. Enable `HTTPS` and restart the containers:
  ```
  ln -s docker-compose-https.yml docker-compose.override.yml
  docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
  ```

It might take a couple of minutes to get the Let's Encrypt signed certificates in place, after which you can enjoy Secure HTTP!

Note that the HTTPS configuration is only possible if your server is exposed to the Internet (either directly or through NAT) as Let's Encrypt needs to authenticate the service.

# Data persistence
Data (database, certificates, ...) is stored in docker named volumes and persists across container/system restart.

 If you really want/need to delete the volumes and the associated data, run:
 ```
 docker-compose down --volumes
 ```

# Configuring the dashboard
This section covers the settings specific to this project; detailed instructions on how to use Node-RED and Grafana is outside the scope of this document.

## Node-RED
### Getting data from The Things Network
_The Things Network Node-RED Nodes_ are already installed in the Node-RED instance. Information on how to configure these is available in the [Quickstart](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/nodered-app-node/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md#configuring-your-application)

### Storing data in InfluxDB
Configuration of the InfluxDB _Server_ in the InfluxDB nodes:
- `Host`: influxdb
- `Port`: 8086
- `Database`: same as `TTN_INFLUX_DB` parameter (default: ttn)
- `Username`: same as `TTN_INFLUX_USER` parameter (default: ttn-user)
- `Password`: same as `TTN_INFLUX_PASSWORD` parameter
- `Enable secure (SSL/TLS) connection`: unchecked

## Grafana
Create an InfluxDB data source (leave all fields not mentioned here to their default value):
- `URL`: http://influxdb:8086
- `Database`: same as `TTN_INFLUX_DB` parameter (default: ttn)
- `User`: same as `TTN_INFLUX_READ_USER` parameter (default: ttn-read)
- `Password`: same as `TTN_INFLUX_READ_PASSWORD` parameter

# Advanced Configuration

## Additional parameters
The setup can be further customised (usernames, log level, ...) in the `.env`. It should be self-explanatory.

## Monitoring your servers with collectd
You can monitor your servers with [collectd](https://collectd.org/), and send the data to your InfuxDB instance

### Monitoring the TTN Dashboard host
If you only want to monitor the dashboard host, perform the following easy steps:

1. Install collectd using your operating system package manager (`yum`, `apt`, ...)
1. On the collectd side, ensure the `network` plugin is enabled and configured -- E.g. in `/etc/collectd.conf`:
  ```
  ...
  LoadPlugin network
  ...
  <Plugin network>
    # client setup:
    <Server "127.0.0.1" "25826">
      SecurityLevel None
    </Server>
  ...
  </Plugin>
  ...
  ```
1. Configure InfluxDB in the `.env` configuration file:
  ```
  # Monitoring servers with collectd:
  TTN_INFLUXDB_COLLECTD_ENABLED=true
  # Database name for collectd (by default use the initial DB)
  TTN_INFLUX_COLLECTD_DB=ttn
  # Port to bind on: do NOT bind on your public interface!
  TTN_INFLUXDB_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:25826
  # Security level (none, sign, encrypt)
  INFLUXDB_COLLECTD_SECURITY_LEVEL=none
  ```
1. Re-start collectd and the containers

### Monitoring additional hosts
If you want to monitor additional hosts (e.g. your gateways, ...), you will have to use the (private) IP of your server instead of the loopback interface.\
It is also recommended to encrypt the collectd traffic.

1. Install collectd using your operating system package manager (`yum`, `apt`, ...)
1. On the collectd side, ensure the `network` plugin is enabled and configured -- E.g. in `/etc/collectd.conf`:
  ```
  ...
  LoadPlugin network
  ...
  <Plugin network>
    # client setup:
    <Server "<YourServerPrivateIP>" "25826">
      SecurityLevel Encrypt
      Username "<YourCollectdUser>"
      Password "<YourSecretPassword>"
    </Server>
  ...
  </Plugin>
  ...
  ```
1. Configure InfluxDB in the `.env` configuration file:
  ```
  # Monitoring servers with collectd:
  TTN_INFLUXDB_COLLECTD_ENABLED=true
  # Database name for collectd (by default use the initial DB)
  TTN_INFLUX_COLLECTD_DB=ttn
  # Port to bind on: do NOT bind on your public interface!
  TTN_INFLUXDB_BIND_ADDRESS=<YourServerPrivateIP>:25826
  # Security level (none, sign, encrypt)
  INFLUXDB_COLLECTD_SECURITY_LEVEL=encrypt
  ```
1. Create a file named `auth_file` with the username/password pair you specified in the `/etc/collectd.conf` file:
  ```
  <YourCollectdUser>:<YourSecretPassword>
  ```
1. Copy that file into the `ttn_influxdb` volume
```
$ # the actual volume name may vary depending on your configuration
$ docker volume ls | grep ttn_influxdb
local               ttn-dashboard_ttn_influxdb
$ # copy the file to the volume
$ docker cp auth_file ttn-dashboard_ttn_influxdb:/etc/collectd/
```
1. Re-start collectd and the containers

## Using the NGINX reverse proxy for other containers
The NGINX reverse proxy setup can be used for additional services running on your node, but they must use the same docker network.\
To achieve that, we have to use an external network which needs to be created separately:
```
docker network create proxy-net
```
The external network also needs to be declared in the compose file; the `docker-compose` command becomes:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose-https.yml \
  -f docker-compose-net.yml \
  up -d
```
